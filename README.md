# AI Model Optimization Service

## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Web Console Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-model-service
cd ai-model-service
```

2. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env file with your credentials
```

3. Start the services:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

4. Access the web console at `http://localhost:3000`

### 2. Using the Flutter SDK

1. Add the SDK to your `pubspec.yaml`:
```yaml
dependencies:
  ai_model_sdk: ^1.0.0
```

2. Initialize the SDK:
```dart
import 'package:ai_model_sdk/ai_model_sdk.dart';

// Initialize with your model token
final sdk = AIModelSDK(modelToken: 'your_model_token');
await sdk.initialize();
```

3. Run inference:
```dart
// Prepare input data
final input = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0];

// Run inference
final output = await sdk.inference(input);
print(output);
```

## Uploading Models

1. Log in to the web console
2. Navigate to "Models" > "Upload New Model"
3. Select your model file and optimization settings
4. Click "Upload and Optimize"
5. Once processing is complete, you'll receive a model token

## Subscription Management

1. Free Tier Features:
   - Basic model optimization
   - Up to 3 models
   - 7-day offline access
   - Community support

2. Premium Tier Features:
   - Advanced optimization techniques
   - Unlimited models
   - Model encryption
   - 30-day offline access
   - Priority support
   - Custom optimization parameters

## Security Considerations

1. Model Protection:
   - Premium models are encrypted at rest
   - Secure key management
   - Integrity verification

2. Offline Usage:
   - Models can be used offline within the subscription period
   - Automatic license validation when online
   - Graceful degradation to free features after subscription expiry

## Best Practices

1. Model Optimization:
   - Test models thoroughly after optimization
   - Monitor performance metrics
   - Keep original models as backup

2. SDK Usage:
   - Initialize SDK early in app lifecycle
   - Handle offline scenarios
   - Implement error handling

3. Security:
   - Keep model tokens secure
   - Regularly update SDK
   - Monitor license status

## Troubleshooting

1. Common Issues:
   - Model loading failures
   - Offline access issues
   - Performance problems

2. Solutions:
   - Check network connectivity
   - Verify model token validity
   - Review optimization settings
   - Check subscription status
